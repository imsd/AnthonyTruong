                                          Reading response to The Founder
      Based on the founder game I realized that this game does feature business	mostly, because it shows you how will you
    increase wages for you and the people you hired. When trying both sides of the endings whenever adding a new product could
    increase the wage or not. It turns out that if you donâ€™t release a new technology for your company it will be in matter
    of time the game will cause you to fall rockbottom.The positive aspect the founder game does is playing a game if you 
    wantingto own a company some day start with this game and see what steps you take that will lead to ending that you put 
    thought out the whole game.
