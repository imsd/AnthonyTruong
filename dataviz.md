                                            My proposal idea project
   What my idea to kind of project I thought of is basically about "The best landmarks to go around for any country your traveling to"
   For example it will provide a hologram assistance to where do people go mostly in their countries?, details to what the landmarks history,
   a pictured view about the landmark. If you set to go there it will give you directions to how to go there when it's first time being in 
   a new country that you like to go and wanting to knew the best places to go around the country to see thier locations. The way I would 
   have to do this project in technical terms in unity is using scripts it show all the details, view, and people's optinon about it everytime 
   you would like to click on to a country you want to travel someday. Add on to how would I do this is tehnical terms is getting gameobjects 
   that could spawns in every single answer that you want to know about the landmark you going also it would tell you stats to how many 
   people go to famous landmarks thoughtout the whole year, the reason why is give new travelers the best experence as they sight around 
   the country they desire.
